    "The method relies on the [attention model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) for neural translation. Each word $y_i$ is predicted based on 3 variables: the recurrent state $s_i$, the previously predict word $y_{i - 1}$ and the context vector $c_i$.\n",

    "The model relies on a GRU-backed bidirectoral sequence autoencoder and the hidden state from both directions are combined to form the annotation vector. The weight of each of these annotation vectors is computed via a single layer feedforward neural network. The weights are computed through an alignment model $\\alpha_{ij}$, which models the probability that $x_j$ is aligned with $y_i$.\n",
