    "The standard beam search strategy for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is for the decoder to predict the target sequence word-by-word and maintain a fixed amount of potential word candidates to predict at each step. \n",

    "The drawbacks of this approach are that it is less adaptive, because: \n",
    "*  Some candidates might not be as good as the current best\n",
    "*  Good candidates might not be considered because they missed out on the threshold for candidate inclusion marginally. Addressing this by naively increasing beam search size will result in slowing down the decoder.\n",

    "Standard beam search builds a translation from left-to-right and keeps a fixed number (beam) of translation candidates with the highest log-probability at each time step. If an end-of-sequence (EOS) token is encountered, the beam-size is reduced by 1 and the sequence is added to the candidate list of translations. When the beam-size eventually becomes 0, the log-probability of all the sequences weighted by sequence length is evaluated and the translation with the highest log-probability score is picked."

    "* Relative local threshold pruning: This is similar to the first strategy, but instead of considering the log-probability of the entire sequence, only the log-probability of the last generated word instead of the total sequence score.\n",
    "$$score_w(cand) \\leq rpl * \\max_{c \\in C} {score_w(c)}$$\n",
    "* Maximum candidates per node: This strategy eliminates candidates based on whether too many current candidates share the same predecessor words, in an attempt to diversify the predictions.\n",
