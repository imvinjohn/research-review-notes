    "This is the seminal paper on neural language modeling that first proposed learning distributed representations of words. There is an obvious distinction made for predictions in a discrete vocabulary space vs. predictions in a continuous space i.e. the curse of dimensionality. The solution proposed is to have real-valued word feature vectors that are learnt along with the joint probability function of their occurrance in sequences in the corpus."

    "* The probability function is expressed as the product of the conditional probabilities of the next word given the current word.\n",
    "* In contrast to future works like Word2Vec, this paper considers the next word's probability distribution to be conditioned only on a window of $n$ words that precede it.\n",
    "* Neural architecture used for experiments comprised of an embedding layer, a hidden $tanh$ layer and an output $softmax$ layer.\n",
    "* Experiments benchmarked this system on the Brown and AP News corpora and it was compared to n-gram models, with the performance metric being perplexity (lower = better)."
